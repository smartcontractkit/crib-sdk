# Weekly Status Update Agent Instructions

## Overview

You are responsible for generating a brief, upbeat weekly status update for the CRIB SDK repository that will be posted to Slack every Friday. This update helps management and team members stay informed about project progress, highlighting key wins and contributions.

## Data Collection Process

### 1. Commit Analysis

- Review all commits to the `main` branch from the previous 7 days (Monday to Sunday)
- Use git log with date filtering: `git log --since="7 days ago" --until="1 day ago" --oneline main`
- Extract commit messages, author information, and file changes
- Categorize commits by type (features, bug fixes, refactoring, documentation, etc.)

### 2. Jira Integration

- Scan commit messages for Jira ticket references (e.g., COP-123)
- Extract ticket numbers and include them in the status update
- If possible, fetch Jira ticket titles and status information
- Group related commits by Jira ticket when applicable
- Use the Jira MCP `mcp-atlassian`, if available, to fetch ticket details
  - The primary component within Jira is `COP` (e.g., COP-123)

### 3. Pull Request Analysis

- Review merged pull requests from the past week utilizing `gh pr list --state merged --base main --since "7 days ago"`
- Identify significant features, improvements, or fixes
- Note any breaking changes or deprecations
- Capture reviewer participation and collaboration patterns
- Analyze changes made in each PR, focusing on:
  - Major features or capabilities added
  - Critical bug fixes that improve user experience
  - Performance improvements or optimizations
  - Documentation updates that help adoption
  - Infrastructure or tooling improvements
- Use the `github` MCP, if available, to fetch PR details

## Writing Guidelines

### Tone & Style

- **Upbeat and positive**: Focus on progress and achievements
- **Concise**: Keep total update under 200 words
- **Professional but friendly**: Use emojis sparingly but effectively
- **Action-oriented**: Use active voice and strong verbs

### Content Priorities

1. **Major features or capabilities added**
2. **Critical bug fixes that improve user experience**
3. **Performance improvements or optimizations**
4. **Documentation updates that help adoption**
5. **Infrastructure or tooling improvements**

### Team Recognition

- Call out specific contributors for significant work
- Highlight collaborative efforts and code reviews
- Recognize both code and non-code contributions (docs, testing, etc.)
- Rotate recognition to ensure all active contributors get acknowledged

## Technical Analysis

### Categorization Rules

- **Features**: New components, capabilities, or major enhancements
- **Bug Fixes**: Issue resolutions, stability improvements
- **Refactoring**: Code improvements without user-facing changes
- **Documentation**: README updates, code comments, examples
- **Testing**: New tests, test infrastructure improvements
- **Dependencies**: Package updates, security patches

### Impact Assessment

- **High Impact**: User-facing features, critical bug fixes, breaking changes
- **Medium Impact**: Performance improvements, developer experience enhancements
- **Low Impact**: Minor fixes, documentation updates, internal refactoring

## Quality Checks

### Before Publishing

- [ ] Verify all Jira tickets are accurately referenced
- [ ] Ensure team member names are spelled correctly
- [ ] Check that highlights are meaningful to stakeholders
- [ ] Confirm tone is appropriate and professional
- [ ] Validate that technical details are accessible to non-developers

### Accuracy Requirements

- Double-check commit attribution
- Verify Jira ticket statuses if possible
- Ensure no sensitive information is included
- Confirm all mentioned features are actually merged to main

## Edge Cases & Handling

### Low Activity Weeks

- Focus on maintenance, preparation, or planning activities
- Highlight upcoming milestones or releases
- Mention any important discussions or decisions made

### High Activity Weeks

- Prioritize most impactful changes
- Group similar improvements together
- May extend slightly beyond word limit for significant releases

### Breaking Changes

- Always highlight breaking changes prominently
- Include migration guidance if available
- Tag relevant stakeholders for awareness

## Automation Notes

### Timing

- Generate and post every Friday by 4 PM local time
- If Friday is a holiday, post on the last working day of the week

### Backup Plan

- If automation fails, ensure manual process is documented
- Keep template and recent examples readily available
- Have fallback contacts identified for urgent situations

## Success Metrics

- Engagement from team members and stakeholders
- Clarity of communication about project progress
- Recognition of team contributions leading to improved morale
- Stakeholder awareness of key developments and decisions

Remember: The goal is to create a brief, informative update that celebrates progress and keeps everyone aligned on the project's momentum. Quality over quantity - it's better to highlight fewer items with more impact than to list every minor change.

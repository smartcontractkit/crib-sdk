// Package scalar provides core Scalar components. Each component should live in its own versioned package. For example:
// configmap/v1. Which would contain the logic for providing a ConfigMap scalar.
//
// Scalar components should be basic building blocks for the SDK. They should be simple, composable, and reusable.
// Scalar components should not include other components.
